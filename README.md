# qtex
Qt extensions

This is a header-only C++ library which contains Qt based tools.
The toolset covers all kind of areas and requires at least Qt 5.6.

Furthermore a compiler supporting C++11 is required for most tools.
Some other tools might require C++14 compiler support.

I used and tested these tools with Visual Studio 2013.
